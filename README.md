# Design-Patterns-Tutorial-Observer
Observer pattern is used when you need many other objects to receive updates when another object changes. Example: a performer must send many updates to observers. The benefit is loose coupling - subject (publisher) doesn't need to know anything about observers (subscribers) but the subject may send unnecessary updates to observers that are subscribed.
